The "miner.py" script requires two fundamental parts in order to function:

1- Splinter:
Splinter is a wrapper for Selenium which allows simple yet efficient interactions with a web browser, as well as basic web scraping.
It can be installed using the "pip" utility, and its documentation can be found here: splinter.readthedocs.io

2- Geckodriver:
Although Splinter works with a variety of browsers (and the script can be easily adapted to work with them as well), the latter has been
coded to work with the Firefox browser. In order to do so, it is required that the latest geckodriver release is downloaded and that its
executable file is added to the PATH environmental variable.
Geckodriver can be found here: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
